Understanding the problem
    - what are the inputs that are required in the problem
    - what are the outputs
    - what are the edge cases for user inputs 
    - Do you have enough information to solve the problem
    - how should the important pieces of data be label 


finding examples of the problem
    and comparing it to the current problem


Break down the problem
    psuedo code or just comments that examplain each step of the problem

Problem Solving Problems
Frequency Counters
Pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
This can avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings



Anagrams 
given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such cinema, formed from iceman.

Multiple Pointers Pattern
Creating Pointer or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well


count unique values
Implement a function called countUniqueValues, which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique values in the array. THere can be negative numbers in the array, but it will always be sorted


Sliding Window
This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

Divide and Conquer 
This pattern involve dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then reporting a process with a subset of data.
This pattern can decrease time complexity
