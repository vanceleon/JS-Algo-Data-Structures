 builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted 

 pseudo

 - pick the second element in the array
 - now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary
 - continue to the next element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate through the sort portion (i.e. the left side) to place the element in the correct place.
 - Repeat until array is sorted
