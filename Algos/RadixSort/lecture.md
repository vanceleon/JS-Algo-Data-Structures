#Radix Sort
- a special sorting algorithm that works on lists of numbers
- never makes comparisons between elements!
- it exploits the fact that information about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits.
- *more digits* is a larger number

#Radix Sort Helpers
- In order to implement radix sort, helper functions are helpful:
- getDigit(num, place) - returns the digit in num at the given place value
