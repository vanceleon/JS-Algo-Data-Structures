Selection Sort

-Similar to bubble sort, instead places small values in sorted position

Selection Sort Pseudocode
- store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far
- compare this to next item in the array until you find a smaller number
- if a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be new min, and continue
- if the min is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values.
- repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.
