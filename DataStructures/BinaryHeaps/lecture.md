What is a Binary Heap?
- Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules
- in a maxBinary Heap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

Max Binary Heap
- Each parent has at most two child nodes
- the value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes
- in a max binary heap the paretn is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes. 
- A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first.

Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues
    which are very commonly used DS
