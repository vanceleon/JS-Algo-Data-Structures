#Stack

#Pushing pseudocode

- the function should accept a value
- create a new node with that value
- if there are no node in the stack, set the first and last property to be the newly created node
- if there is at least one node, create a variable that stores the current first property on the stack
- Reset the first property to be the newly created node
- Set the next property on the onde to the previously created variable
- increment the size of the stack by 1
