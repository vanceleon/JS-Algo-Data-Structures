What is a tree?
- DS that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship

Tree Terms
- Root: The top node in a tree
- Child: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
- Siblings: group of nodes with the same parent
- Leaf: A node with no children
- Edge: the connection between one node and another.



Trees are used in 

HTML DOM
- nested elements
- network routing
- abstract syntax tree
- AI, machine learning
- Folders in an OS
- json


Generic Tree
- can have more than 2 children
- no real rules


Binary Tree
- can't have more than two children 
- sorted, less than node is stored to the left, greater than is stored to the right of the root node

How BSTS work 
- Every parent node has at most two children
- Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent 
- Every node to the right of the parent node is always greater than the parent
